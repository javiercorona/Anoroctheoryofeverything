# ANOROC-String Theory of Everything (TOE) Framework

  
*Unifying curvature-regulated gravity with string-theoretic matter*

---

## Description
This repository contains the LaTeX source files for the **ANOROC-String TOE**, a proposed unification of:
- **ANOROC gravity** (4D curvature-regulated spacetime with singularity avoidance via \( K_{\text{max}} \))
- **String Theory** (matter/forces as 1D strings on a 4D brane)

Key features:
- Minimalist TOE with no compactified extra dimensions
- Dual singularity resolution: \( K_{\text{max}} \) + T-duality
- Testable through GW ringdown shifts and collider signatures
